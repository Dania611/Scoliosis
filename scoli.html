            <p style="font-family:Verdana">Most frequently diagnosed in adolescents, Scoliosis is a sideways curvature of the spine. The majority of childhood cases of scoliosis are undiagnosed, although it can happen in people who have diseases like cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy. While mild scoliosis affects the majority of people, some curves get worse as kids get older.</p>

            <p style="font-family:Verdana"> There are two types of scoliosis: S-shaped and C-shaped. C-shape seems to force your body more to the side. As seen in this photo: </p>

            <p style="font-family:Verdana"> There is also and S-curve scoliosis. Depending on how large the curve is, S-curved scoliosis can be hidden and harder to tell. As seen in this photo:</p>

            <p style="font-family:Verdana"> There are many different types of treatments for different types of curves. Such as:  Bracing, Physio Therapy and Excercise (stretching, swimming, etc.), Spinal injections, The Schroth method, Mehta Casting and more. Treatment does not straighten your back, but stops the curve from becoming larger. However, treatment is only reccomended when a curvature is 40º and below. If the curvature is above 40º, or treatment just simply is not working, a Spinal Fusion is reccomended.</p>
            <p style="font-family:Verdana"> A Spinal Fusion is an operation to straighten the Spine from either Scoliosis or Kyphosis. It is a procedure used in orthopedic or neurosurgical surgery to connect two or more vertebrae. Any level of the spine can be used for this procedure, which stops any movement between the fused vertebrae.</p>

            <p> <h1 style="font-family:Monospace">A Final Message</h1> </p>
            <p style="font-family:Verdana">My final message to those with Scoliosis is that all of the fear is in your head, and none of it is real. You can talk to patients, doctors, researchers if it makes you feel better. Yes it is scary. Knowing that their is a possibility that treatment could not work, and that you might need surgery is stressful. However, at the end of the day, there will always be a solution. Wether its a hard one or not, you will get through, it will be a bumpy ride, but you'll make it to the end. Scoliosis is a journey that you learn from, not something you should dread. </p>

            <p> <h1 style="font-family:Monospace">My Story</h1> </p>
            <p style="font-family:Verdana"> I found out I had Scoliosis when I was 12 years old, in Grade 7. It was around december, my birthday had just past. My friend was actually the person who has pointed it out, by sayinng that something about my back seemed weird. She snapped a picture, and I sent it to me my imedietly. My mom ofcourse thought I was parnking her, that was until I got home.</p>
        <img src="IMG_9808.PNG" style="width:200px;height:300px;">
        <p style="font-family:Verdana"> When I got home, and she saw it for herself, she booked a doctor appointment for the next morning. I get to the doctor, and he examines my back by dragging his finger in an S-Shape down my back. That day he had diagnosed me Scoliosis. The next day I got my first ever X-Ray. When I got the results, I knew this journey wasn't going to be an easy fix.</p>

        <p style="font-family:Verdana"> I had about a 70º curvature, along with two smaller ones, one being about 45º, and the other around 15º. Surgery was needed. Not just because treatment wasn't working, but because my curve was already pushing on my lungs, which meant if it progressed, it would make its way to my heart. I told my surgeon to give me a couple months, so I could mentally prepare myself for my first, and hopefully, biggest surgery. </p>
<p style="font-family:Verdana"> 4 months pass by, It's march. My surgery is in 14 days. Its the only thing on my mind, weirdly, i'm less scared now. I think with a lot of reserach and speaking to professionals, fear tends to go away.
    After two weeks, I made my way to Abdali Hospital in Amman, Jordan, where I was going to have a 6-hour spinal fusion done by Dr. Mutaz Jadaan. I would then have to spend 5 days in the hospital, where I could hardly move, but was still slowly being taught how to walk and function properly again. Here is a before and after picture of my spine (before:right, after:left):
